# Staxel Mod Builder

A simple set of programs and scripts to enhance the experience of building Staxel Mods!

## Staxel Mod .lang Generator
This program is a simple console-based script that allows you to enter a folder-path and will then scan for `.tile` files within that folder and all its subfolders. It will use the `code` field of each `.tile` file to create a `.lang` file with `name` and `description` which is saved in the given folder under the folder's name followed by `.lang`.

### Usage
Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Dan6erbond/Staxel-Mod-Builder/releases) and enter the folder-path and press enter. If you need to generate more files, the program will stay open until you press Ctrl + C so the process can be repeated. If any errors are thrown you should screenshot the output and submit it under the (Issues)[https://github.com/Dan6erbond/Staxel-Mod-Builder/issues].
