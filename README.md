# Staxel Mod Builder

A simple set of programs and scripts to enhance the experience of building Staxel Mods!

## Lang Generator
This program is a simple console-based script that allows you to enter a folder-path and will then scan for `.tile` files within that folder and all its subfolders. It will use the `code` field of each `.tile` file to create a `.lang` file with `name` and `description` which is saved in the given folder under the folder's name followed by `.lang`.
